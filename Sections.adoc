.Notes:
1. Local tables shall define those parts of the Master table that are reserved for local use except for the case described in note (2). In any case, the use of Local tables in messages intended for non-local or international exchange is strongly discouraged.
2. If master tables version number is 255 then only local tables are in use. The local tables version number must not be zero nor missing, and local tables may include entries from the entire range of the tables.

== Section 2 - Repetitions and Index Section

[format="csv", options="header"]

include::./Sections/Section_2.csv[]
|===

.Notes:
1. A message with only one field shall have the total number of repetitions and each of the number of distinct sections set to 1.
2. Two repeated sections shall never be identical. If two sections are identical because they have the same content, one of the two shall be coded with only 7 bytes (empty section with reference) and the SUI shall be coded with the same value of the identical section to which this section refers. Each section  will therefore have content in it or refer to another section of the same section number. In the latter case, it will be made only of 7 bytes comprising section length (4 bytes), number of section (1 byte) and Section Unique Identifier - SUI (2 bytes).
3. The inclusion of an Index template is optional. If index template is not present, the index template number (bytes 21-22) shall be set to missing (all bits set to 1) and the length of index template (bytes 23-26) shall be set to zero.
